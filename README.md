# Capacitor Community Proposals

Use this repository to create proposals for new Capacitor Community plugins and platforms.

## Usage

Proposals are written in issues.

To create a new proposal,

1. Search for existing proposals in [the issues](https://github.com/capacitor-community/proposals/issues). The proposal may exist already. If it does, consider reading through it and adding your thoughts. You can also react to proposals by adding a :+1: reaction.
1. If it does not exist, [create a new issue](https://github.com/capacitor-community/proposals/issues/new/choose) and fill out the template. :sparkles:
